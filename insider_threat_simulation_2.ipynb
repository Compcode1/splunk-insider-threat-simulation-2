    "üîç **Attacker Simulation Synopsis (Phase 1: Host Compromise Actions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 ‚Äì Failed + Successful Logons**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Three failed logon attempts followed by a successful logon using the Steve account.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Brute-force or password guessing attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: A malicious insider or external actor tries to access a user account (successfully), possibly after credential harvesting or phishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 ‚Äì Obfuscated PowerShell Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Used variable indirection to launch notepad.exe via iex. Used variable indirection to launch Notepad via iex, a method commonly used by attackers to evade detection. Instead of calling the binary directly, the command was stored in a variable and executed dynamically, simulating lightweight obfuscation tactics often seen in PowerShell-based attacks.\n",
    " \n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Living-off-the-land (LOTL) technique using PowerShell obfuscation to evade detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: Scripted malware or post-exploitation tools (e.g., Cobalt Strike) hiding execution chains within PowerShell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 ‚Äì Scheduled Task Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Created scheduled task Updater2 to run mspaint.exe at user logon. MSPaint (Microsoft Paint) is a built-in Windows graphical editing tool used for creating and modifying images. In this simulation, it's a benign executable chosen to demonstrate persistence without triggering antivirus, mimicking how attackers might use trusted programs or LOLBins to maintain stealthy footholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Establishing persistence through legitimate OS tasking mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: APTs or malware deploy scheduled tasks to reinitiate malicious payloads (e.g., remote access tools) after reboot or logon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 ‚Äì Simulated Lateral Movement Attempt**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Ran mstsc /v:192.168.56.102 and net use \\\\192.168.56.102\\C$, captured via Wireshark. mstsc /v:<IP> launches the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client and attempts to connect to the specified IP address, simulating how attackers try to gain interactive desktop access to remote systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "net use \\\\<IP>\\C$ tries to connect to the default administrative SMB share (the C$ drive) on the target system, mimicking lateral movement via network file access.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Attempted use of RDP and SMB to access another internal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: Attackers use stolen credentials to pivot between hosts, exploiting trust relationships and misconfigured shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5 ‚Äì Nmap Scan of External Target**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Port scan against 192.168.56.102 targeting common ports (22, 80, 443, etc.). Executed a port scan against 192.168.56.102, a fabricated private IP address used solely to simulate attacker lateral movement or reconnaissance behavior. Although this IP does not map to an active system, Nmap may still return \"filtered\" results due to the way local network firewalls or the OS respond (or drop) unsolicited packets. This models how attackers often probe local subnets for reachable hosts ‚Äî even if the scans result in timeouts or filtered responses, the attempt itself is a valuable signal for detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Network reconnaissance after foothold to find lateral movement or data exfiltration paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: Attackers scan internal ranges for open services like RDP, HTTP apps, or unpatched legacy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6 ‚Äì Nmap Scan of Local Host**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Scanned 127.0.0.1 to identify open ports and services running on the compromised system. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, which refers to the local machine itself. By scanning this address, the attacker is probing the host they currently control to discover what services are exposed internally ‚Äî a common post-exploitation reconnaissance technique in real-world attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Privilege-aware reconnaissance to enumerate local services or potential privilege escalation vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: An attacker inside a host audits its surface area (e.g., Splunk ports, open RDP) to deploy exploits or install implants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7 ‚Äì Simulated Privilege Escalation**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Executed: Ran whoami /priv and icacls C:\\Windows to probe privilege levels and file system access. whoami /priv lists the current user's security privileges, revealing what actions they are authorized to perform. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impersonation: The ability to temporarily adopt the security context of another user. Attackers can abuse this to perform actions as a more privileged account without directly acquiring its credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: The right to attach a debugger to processes, including those running as system or other users. Malicious actors may exploit this to inspect or manipulate memory, inject code, or escalate privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shutting down the system: Grants authority to power off or restart the machine. While seemingly basic, this privilege can be abused in ransomware operations or availability attacks to disrupt business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second command, icacls C:\\Windows, displays the access control list (ACL) for the core Windows directory. This helps determine which users or groups have permission to read, modify, or take ownership of system-critical files ‚Äî essential for evaluating privilege escalation paths\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Simulated Behavior: Post-compromise privilege inspection, a prelude to escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "üè¢ Enterprise Analogy: Threat actors enumerate permissions to assess whether they can dump credentials, modify services, or escalate to SYSTEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**This simulation captures core, widely observed attacker behaviors aligned with common enterprise intrusion patterns. From brute-force access to obfuscated execution, persistence, recon, and privilege assessment, each step reflects actions that threat actors commonly execute after compromising a host. Understanding and detecting these behaviors forms the foundation of SOC operations and enables timely incident response.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SIEM Alert Summary: Suspicious Local Host Activity Detected**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Alert Trigger:**\n",
    "Multiple high-risk actions observed within a short timeframe on local host DESKTOP-UPKRV33 (127.0.0.1), including privilege enumeration, file system access checks, scheduled task creation, and process execution via obfuscated PowerShell.\n",

    "\n",
    "**‚úÖ Insider Threat Simulation ‚Äì Final Write-up** \n",

    "Most critical gap: process creation (4688) not visible in Splunk during or after simulation.\n",
